% Set coefficients for entrained and detrained fluid properties for
% mixing (turbulent) entrainment/detrainment.
% Value of 1 means property of departed fluid does not change
% Value of 0 means property of receiving fluid does not change

% Note: setting bentrain < 1 introduces a positive feedback that can
% cause the solver to diverge when the entrainment timescale is short
% (e.g. idealised dry CBL case with large initial surface heat flux).
% It appears to be less of a problem in more realistic cases that spin
% up more gradually.
